# very basic ( level 0 ) algorithms

Mostly these will be implemented after project is de-iced.

## list

1. custom simple hash algorithm.
2. lz random motifs algorithm.
3. custom prng.
4. object sequences generalization algorithm.
5. custom symmetric encryption algorithm.
6. human language and filetype detection algorithm.

## structure

Mostly these are given implementations in:

- python, as a single file module.
- javascript, as a module that runs as a service in a worker.
