- Allow the preface to me a message parameter that is rendered in the HTML.
- Session object works to be a Media. 
- Perhaps a CaveSession API ? 
- Refactor and clean up code.

DONE - Add login session checks on each service.
DONE - Add command output to pages. 
DONE - Add some new HTML to a service's page after a post has been performed to indicate the next step in a clear way. 
- Increase orienting information in command scripts.
- Add favicon.ico ( or other static files ) handlers. Perhaps make the dispatcher really a dispatcher and not just serving a link to login.
