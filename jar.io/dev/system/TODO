Java Code and HTML Todo
  - Sessions, Cave, Humans refactor, and improvement-creating upgrade
    - Session object works to be a Media. 
      - Perhaps a CaveSession API ? 
    - Refactor and clean up code.
      - Particularly the cross cutting concern of humans, cave and session
      where services make regard to those. Answer the question what is a clean and decoupled and minimum effort way to have Services access cave and the CaveHumanAPI and sessions ? 
  - Add unit tests. 
  - Add favicon.ico ( or other static files ) handlers. Perhaps make the dispatcher really a dispatcher and not just serving a link to login.
