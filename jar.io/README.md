# Usage Instructions

## Building your uploaded project

The interface presents the steps required to upload, unzip, build, rezip and download a project in a linear fashion. To perform such a task, simply follow the steps as presented by the interface.

The only choice you need to make is whether you will build with javac or with maven. After unzipping, you will have two options, building with javac or with maven. Choose the option appropriate for the project you want to build.
