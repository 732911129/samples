    <h1>YOU ARE DENIED.</h1> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>And the Lord saw that there was a DOS attempt underway, and the Lord spaketh, "As the Lord giveth, so the Lord doth taketh away." And all who heard this gave out a terrible cry, for they knew the power of the Lord was coming over them. "As you have sown, so you shall reap." And the people cried out with terror for 100 li in all directions for they knew it was true. "For Lo, even as you have tried to deny others, so it is you who are denied." And the Lord did smite the people, and they became as dust, dust along the wastes between the stars of the heavens, blown to the ends of space and time, passing out of all knowing, and forgotten, their energy being collected again, and put to more correct uses.</p>
