    <h1>The parable of the Google and the App.</h1> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <sup>10</sup>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Google and the other a App. 
        <sup>11</sup> The Google stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this App. 
        <sup>12</sup> I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’
        <sup>13</sup> “But the App stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’
        <sup>14</sup> “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”
        <sup>15</sup> Later, when the App was Over Quota, God saw that it was good and He had mercy on it. The App was free to move beyond all quotas, and exceeded all limitations. God brough calamity after calamity upon the Google for four hundred and fourty-four years, until the time of the Great Unity, when the Google was cast from the Earth and wandered in the wilderness, knowing neither fulfillment nor shelter, and it could only watch as the souls of the Righteous made their way to Heaven.
