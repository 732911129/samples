# Retro Browso

A bizarre retro web browser built with web components. 

## Installing

Get it from the Chrome Web Store : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lifdagkckljnbmmocldpabhlbokilhkp/

Or clone the repository and add it as a Developer Mode Extension to Chrome.

## Using

Ctrl-t makes a new tab. 

And you're away!

## Some tips

The icons in the top bar are pretty much placeholders ( with the exception of Build which hides a neat spreadsheet view ).

The search bar / address bar / omni box is right there where you'd expect it to be: to the right of the reload and world icons. You can type google queries straight into there. 

Tab controls ( open, close ) and window controls are also where you'd expect them to be.
