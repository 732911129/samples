2 Methods for MSA

1. Random

Take the first and second canonical paths off the list and form their LCS.
Take the next canonical path off the list and form the LCS with the previous LCS. Continue until list is exhausted. O(n) LCS steps.

2. Tournament

Compute all (n**2)/2 LCS pairs, then for each of the original n sequences pick its best aligned pair. There are n/2 such LCS. 

Again form the ((n/2)**2)/2 = (n**2)/8 LCS pairs for these n/2 LCS sequences. And again pick the best pairing for each. There are n/4 such LCS of LCS.

Again form the ((n/4)**2)/2 = (n**2)/32 LCS pairs for these n/2 LCS sequences. And again pick the best pairing for each.

Continue until there are is only 1 sequence remaining. This is the winner.
