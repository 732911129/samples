# Development Progress 

This file tracks design, implementation, test and bugs discussion for feature-request-sample.

## Design Sketches

The description is well specified, since they provide a clear target data structure.

Idea is just to build:

- a view for this data structure
- a summary view for this data structure
- and some support structures such as:
 - collection view
 - search view
- a simple server with a single API endpoint ( for the data structure given )
- possibly, some different CSS skins for the app
