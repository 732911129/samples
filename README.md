# a staging area for projects

What is this? Projects are staged here, and test releases and other releases are put on labs. 

When the release becomes more stable, it can move from labs to media.

So the idea is :

project staging -> labs -> media

## current residents

- basics
- usfe
- sample works

## current todo

- do basics
- do usfe
- do sample works
=======
# Work Samples

- A client server Java app built using Maven that permits a file upload.
